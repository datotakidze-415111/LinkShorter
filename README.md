# LinkShorter


first of all, welcome to my Link Shortener service project

In this project I did it: 
1) Guest Dashboard => guest can shorter any links, but it can't view how many visitors have had on short links
2) user dashboard => you can log in/signup/logout and then add short links, also you can view your links list, visitors and you can delete any short link

if you want to start this project you need to download the project then install npm packages and write in terminal => npm start

I used this npm pacgakes: 
1) bcryptjs
2) config
3) connect-flash
4) dotenv
5) ejs
6) express
7) express-ejs-layout
8) express-session
9) jsownwebtoken (jwt)
10) jwt-decode
11) mongoose
12) nodemon
13) shortid
14) valid-url
